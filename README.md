# JATE Text Editor PWA

[Link to deployed site] (https://justanothertexteditor-jate-pwa.herokuapp.com/)

## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Tasks
- initial code and guides were provided by professor
- Configuring the routing in the src-sw.js file to supply a caching strategy
- Configure the plug-ins and rules in the webpack.config.js
- Add code to update and get information from IndexedDB
- Add code for installing the PWA locally

## My Learnings
- how to setup and configure the different components to create a PWA
- how IndexedDB works and how to utilize it in a PWA
- how a service worker works and how to utilize it in a PWA
- learned about webpacks

## Future Improvements
- look into why the IndexedDB is showing in the dev console for Safari, but not for Chrome
